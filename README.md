# Escape-Sequences-in-Strings

Quotes are not the only characters that can be escaped inside a string. 

 There are two reasons to use escaping characters:

          1. To allow you to use characters you may not otherwise be able to type out, such as a carriage return.
2. To allow you to represent multiple quotes in a string without JavaScript misinterpreting what you mean.
